P3 Demo Cheat Sheet. (First Draft)

Laptop: 
 -- Select the Terminal window. 
 -- Type: prun [Enter]
 -- Wait for terminal prompt to return.
 -- In the exploerer window the p3demo.trace and p3demo.p3 files will dissapear. This shows that we are creating -new- traces every time we run the demo.

 Android: 
 -- Tap the icon that says "Terminal" to open it (I made a "desktop" icon for it). 
 -- Type: su [Enter] prun [Enter]
 -- Wait for terminal prompt to return.
 -- Tap the Home button to return to the main screen.
 -- Tap the Browser button to open the browser.
 -- In the browser tap the Star button (Top right) to bring up the Bookmarks menu.
 -- Tap the URL labeled http://192.168.0.110/words256k.html ; This should bring up a webpage with 256k worth of textual data on it.
 -- Tap the Home button, to return to the desktop. 
 -- Tap the Terminal button again, and type: pend [Enter]
 -- Wait for terminal prompt to return.

Laptop:
 -- Select the Terminal window. 
 -- Type: pend [Enter]
 -- Wait for terminal prompt to return.
 -- There should now be a new pair of documents in the Explorer window; p3trace.trace and p3trace.p3
